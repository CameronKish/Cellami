    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: December 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>By default, Cellami ("the Add-in") connects directly to a complementary application running locally on your
        device ("Cellami desktop application"), and all AI processing is performed locally. The Add-in does not transmit
        your Excel data to external cloud servers owned by the publisher.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party AI Providers</h2>
    <p>If you choose to enable optional cloud-based features (such as "Turbo Mode" or external API connections), your
        data may be transmitted directly to the configured third-party provider for processing. The publisher does not
        have access to this data, and its handling is subject to the privacy policy of the respective third-party
        provider.</p>

    <h2>3. Local Data</h2>
    <p>Data stored by the Cellami desktop application (such as Knowledge Base files and Chat History) is persisted only
        on your local hard drive. You maintain full control and ownership of this data.</p>

    <h2>4. Telemetry</h2>
    <p>The Add-in may collect anonymous technical telemetry (such as crash reports or usage statistics) to improve
        stability. This telemetry does not contain personal information or user content.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via our support channel.</p>
